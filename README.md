Webapp and backend to change music playing in host machine 
uses vlc.py and youtube-dl. There might be some other needed third party libraries.
Currently developing no-javascript version.
##Currently working:
- App can find songs from youtube, parse usefull information and display it.
- When clicked on search results App plays local test song. 
- Streaming to named pipe works in linux but playing from there is not.
